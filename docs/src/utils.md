# Utilities

Zygote provides a set of helpful utilities. These are all "user-level" tools –
in other words you could have written them easily yourself, but they live in
Zygote for convenience.

```@docs
Zygote.@showgrad
Zygote.hook
Zygote.dropgrad
Zygote.hessian
Zygote.Buffer
Zygote.forwarddiff
Zygote.nograd
```
