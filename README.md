`] add Zygote`

Zygote provides source-to-source automatic differentiation (AD) in Julia, and is the next-gen AD system for the [Flux](https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl) differentiable programming framework. For more details and benchmarks of Zygote's technique, see [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.07951). You may want to check out Flux for more interesting examples of Zygote usage; the documentation here focuses on internals and advanced AD usage.

Zygote supports Julia 1.0 onwards, but we highly recommend using Julia 1.3 or later.

```julia
julia> using Zygote

julia> f(x) = 5x + 3

julia> f(10), f'(10)
(53, 5)

julia> @code_llvm f'(10)
define i64 @"julia_#625_38792"(i64) {
top:
  ret i64 5
}
```

"Source-to-source" means that Zygote hooks into Julia's compiler, and generates the backwards pass for you – as if you had written it by hand.

Without compromising on performance, Zygote supports the full flexibility and dynamism of the Julia language, including control flow, recursion, closures, structs, dictionaries, and more.

```julia
julia> fs = Dict("sin" => sin, "cos" => cos, "tan" => tan);

julia> gradient(x -> fs[readline()](x), 1)
sin
0.5403023058681398
```

Defining custom gradients is a cinch, and errors have good stacktraces.

```julia
julia> using Zygote: @adjoint

julia> add(a, b) = a + b

julia> @adjoint add(a, b) = add(a, b), Δ -> (Δ, Δ)
```

To support large machine learning models with many parameters, Zygote can differentiate implicitly-used parameters, as opposed to just function arguments.

```julia
julia> W, b = rand(2, 3), rand(2);

julia> predict(x) = W*x .+ b;

julia> g = gradient(Params([W, b])) do
         sum(predict([1,2,3]))
       end
Grads(...)

julia> g[W], g[b]
([1.0 2.0 3.0; 1.0 2.0 3.0], [1.0, 1.0])
```
