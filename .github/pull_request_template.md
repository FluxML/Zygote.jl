<!--
Thanks for filing a PR! Please delete this comment and describe your change here.

For bugfixes, please detail the bug and include a test case which your patch fixes.
If you are adding a new feature, please clearly describe the design, its rationale, the possible alternatives considered.
It is easiest to merge new features when there is clear precedent in other systems; we need to know we're taking
the right direction since it can be hard to change later.

If you are refactoring an existing, undocumented functionality (including internal functions), please try to document it.
